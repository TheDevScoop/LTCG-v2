# Card Studio Status

Card Studio is no longer part of the active LTCG-v2 runtime.

Removed from active surfaces:

- Convex host functions and schema tables
- Primary web routing/navigation
- Studio-specific backend endpoints in the default runtime path

Current repository status:

- `packages/lunchtable-tcg-card-studio-sdk` remains as a standalone SDK package.
- Legacy references may exist in historical docs/plans, but they are not part of current deployment targets.

If Card Studio is reintroduced later, treat it as a fresh scoped feature with explicit architecture, schema, and routing docs.
